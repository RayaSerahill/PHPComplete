# PHPComplete
This is a repository where I store my PHP modules that I frequently use on other projects, such as database manager, login and register. The point isn't to make a working website.

## Ready modules
 - **Register** - All in one Registration script to securely add new users

## Planned modules/features
 - **Login** - Basic login module with "remember me" option and possibly 2FA
 - **Register** - Adding email confirmation support
 - **Database manager** - A wrapper that supports seamless use of multiple database types
 - **User management** - Basic api to elevate/delete/edit/list all users
